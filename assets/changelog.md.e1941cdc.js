Then I realized that @timofei-iatsenko and I had a discord convo where we renamed one of the props, and I forgot to apply that before merging. _technically_ this is a breaking change, but it\'s late on a Saturday and it\'s like 04:30 GMT so I\'m going to yolo this fix. Apologies to anyone that this causes a headache for. Oh and this adds docs.

jsx-email to make sure the preview app package was on a minimum version. that would have created more burden for users. the package size purists won\'t be happy with the increase in size of the main package, especially those not using the preview, but overall it\'s a better

This is technically a breaking change, but the use of the `compile` export hasn\'t taken hold yet since it was just released a day or two ago, so we\'re going to go off-script a bit and do a technically-breaking-change in a patch release. You can yell at me if you\'d like, it\'s OK I can take it. \\r\\n\\r\\nNextjs crappy bundling strikes again. The web is littered with people who have the unfortunate situation of importing a module which happens to import ebuild, and webpack _shockingly he said sarcastically_ doesn\'t tree shake it out. So users end up with bundling errors after having done seemingly nothing wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nI really dislike Nextjs for stuff like this, and the fact that they\'re still using webpack in 2024 is [mind bottling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSfebOXSBOE).

The `assert` syntax was used up until v22, and the `with` syntax _started_ being supported in node v18.20. `jsx-email` supports version 18.19+ meaning using the `with` syntax would be a breaking change. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe reading of JSON was happening when the cli tool was reading from the `package.json`. This PR introduces the change that instead of reading the `package.json` as a module, we read it inside a `.cts` file which does not use the same `assert`/`with` syntax. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis PR is a little tricky to test (and why there are no test cases added), but it looks to work on node versions: `18.19.0`, `18.20.0`, and `22.6.0`. I don\'t believe any issues should occur because the `\\"esModuleInterop\\"` option in the `tsconfig.json` is set to `true`, but some extra care wouldn\'t hurt.\\r\\n<!--\\r\\n  Please be thorough and

templates, and the airbnb template in `/apps/demo/emails` has a working

This is important for a number of reasons; the primary one making sure that when dependencies are added or removed from the preview app, that the app itself doesn\'t break in dev mode.

This was due to how `rehype` enforces proper HTML structure. Because we were wrapping `<head>` elements with `<div>` to be able to output raw HTML, rehype was wagging its finger because that\'s not valid HTML. This changes the wrapping element to `<head>` and should resolve the

With using the `as: \'url\'` method of `import.meta.glob` to get the file paths of the templates loaded in production, we\'re given back completely different values than running in dev. Many of those values are base64 octet data urls, which is useless for our needs. The clue to a fix was the relative path that vite was using. Calculating that ourselves and injecting it into the bundle gave us something that we could use in both prod and dev preview

Previously, users would have to prefix any environment variables they wanted to use in templates (with the preview) with `VITE_` due to using Vite under the hood for the preview server. This is a poor experience. Changes in this PR make the full `process.env` value set available to templates for the preview

Unfortunately the way that pnpm, yarn, and npm differ in how they create binaries in node_modules/.bin causes an issue where yarn and npm have no idea about the path context of where the intermediate file will be run, hence it can\'t find node_modules and jsx-email.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder pnpm, the binary file in node_modules/.bin contains path information whereas npm and yarn are just straight up copies of the target file. Under pnpm, the compiled template file has context as to where it\'s being run, so it can use the local node_modules. Apparently on npm/yarn, this is not the

I made some contributions to the the OG react-email project, but it is time to update things, so I\'m taking this out for a spin. \\r\\n\\r\\nI really like the simplified dev env through vite, that seems much more intuitive to me as well. However, I\'d like replicate some behavior that we built a bit of our CI tooling around: static asset handling. \\r\\n\\r\\n`react-email` would do a very large and spooky copy/paste of assets in order to make them available during development. I\'d like to keep the feature of using local assets in development. \\r\\n\\r\\nTurning of vite\'s `fs.strict` field allows a dev to import (via `import.meta.resolve`) a local file that is outside of the vite preview project, which is nestled deep in node_modules. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnless there is a more canonical why of doing this, check out my example I added to the docs for how it could work (and does with a monkey patch on my project).\\r\\n\\r\\n(I\'d like help with tests, I wasn\'t sure how to integrate using `import.meta.resolve` in the test file because the tsconfig module was not set to `ESNext`.\\r\\nI tried with `path` and `__dirname`, but then also realized that it would resolve to the local machine, not the test env 😬

Gmail in particular has a message clipping threshold of 102kb. With these changes it\'s easy to see at a glance if an email template is exceeding that threshold when running `email build`. The `email check` command will now display errors (over the threshold) or warnings (near the threshold) for email template output.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<img width=\\"452\\" alt=\\"Screenshot 2023-12-02 at
